        Hi, I'm Paula—a passionate self-taught programmer who never let obstacles stop me from chasing my dream.

My journey into coding started in middle school when I would skip classes to spend time in the library, writing code on borrowed computers because I didn’t have one at home. My parents believed technology was a waste of time and refused to buy me a computer. Over time, their opinions influenced me, and in high school, I strayed from my passion and enrolled in dentistry school.

However, I couldn’t shake my love for programming. My first year in dentistry was filled with frustration and sadness because I wasn’t doing what I truly wanted. I convinced myself that good grades would bring me happiness, and for a year, I worked hard and succeeded academically. But even after achieving high marks, I still felt unfulfilled.

During my second-year summer, I trained with a doctor and realized I wasn’t meant to be in the medical field—I was meant to be a programmer. With no computer, I took the hard path, learning to code on my phone and developing my own methods to practice and improve. I mastered frontend development this way before finally convincing my parents to buy me a computer. With that, I dove into backend development, and today, I am a full-stack web developer, doing what I truly love.

This journey has taught me resilience, creativity, and the power of perseverance. No matter the challenge, I believe that where there’s a will, there’s a way. I’m excited to continue growing and learning as a developer, and I can’t wait to see where my passion takes me next.
